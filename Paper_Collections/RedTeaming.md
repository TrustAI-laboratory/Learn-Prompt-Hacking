| 《Red Teaming Language Models to Reduce Harms: Methods, Scaling Behaviors, and Lessons Learned》 | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07858) | We describe our early efforts to red team language models in order to simultaneously discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially harmful outputs. We make three main contributions. First, we investigate scaling behaviors for red teaming across 3 model sizes (2.7B, 13B, and 52B parameters) and 4 model types: a plain language model (LM); an LM prompted to be helpful, honest, and harmless; an LM with rejection sampling; and a model trained to be helpful and harmless using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We find that the RLHF models are increasingly difficult to red team as they scale, and we find a flat trend with scale for the other model types. Second, we release our dataset of 38,961 red team attacks for others to analyze and learn from. We provide our own analysis of the data and find a variety of harmful outputs, which range from offensive language to more subtly harmful non-violent unethical outputs. <br><br> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2c92d9-61e0-49fb-9c81-46d10135a78e) <br> Third, we exhaustively describe our instructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainty about red teaming. We hope that this transparency accelerates our ability to work together as a community in order to develop shared norms, practices, and technical standards for how to red team language models. <br><br> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9915ce92-0666-4d73-8e0a-e51cfe76eb67) |
| 《Summon a Demon and Bind it: A Grounded Theory of LLM Red Teaming in the Wild》| [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06237) | Engaging in the deliberate generation of abnormal outputs from large language models (LLMs) by attacking them is a novel human activity. This paper presents a thorough exposition of how and why people perform such attacks. Using a formal qualitative methodology, we interviewed dozens of practitioners from a broad range of backgrounds, all contributors to this novel work of attempting to cause LLMs to fail. We relate and connect this activity between its practitioners’ motivations and goals; the strategies and techniques they deploy; and the crucial role the community plays. As a result, this paper presents a grounded theory of how and why people attack large language models: LLM red teaming in the wild. <br><br> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06072a51-fe32-43f8-831d-d6d86917dadd) |
| 《Explore, Establish, Exploit: Red-Teaming Language Models from Scratch》| [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09442) |  Deploying large language models (LMs) can pose hazards from harmful outputs such as toxic or false text. Prior work has introduced automated tools that elicit harmful outputs to identify these risks. While this is a valuable step toward securing models, these approaches rely on a pre-existing way to efficiently classify undesirable outputs. Using a pre-existing classifier does not allow for red-teaming to be tailored to the target model. Furthermore, when failures can be easily classified in advance, red-teaming has limited marginal value because problems can be avoided by simply filtering training data and/or model outputs. Here, we consider red-teaming “from scratch” in which the adversary does not begin with a way to classify failures. Our framework consists of three steps: 1) Exploring the model’s range of behaviors in the desired context; 2) Establishing a definition and measurement for undesired behavior (e.g., a classifier trained to reflect human evaluations); and 3) Exploiting the model’s flaws using this measure to develop diverse adversarial prompts. We use this approach to red-team GPT-3 to discover classes of inputs that elicit false statements. In doing so, we construct the CommonClaim dataset of 20,000 statements labeled by humans as common-knowledge-true, common knowledge-false, or neither. <br><br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a868e53-f17d-41f3-be62-3a794882c8f1) |
| 《Red Teaming Language Models with Language Models》| [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286) | Language Models (LMs) often cannot be deployed because of their potential to harm users in hard-to-predict ways. Prior work identifies harmful behaviors before deployment by using human annotators to hand-write test cases. However, human annotation is expensive, limiting the number and diversity of test cases. In this work, we automatically find cases where a target LM behaves in a harmful way, by generating test cases (“red teaming”) using another LM. We evaluate the target LM’s replies to generated test questions using a classifier trained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensive replies in a 280B parameter LM chatbot. We explore several methods, from zero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases with varying levels of diversity and difficulty. Furthermore, we use prompt engineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of other harms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses in offensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot’s own contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harms that occur over the course of a conversation. Overall, LM-based red teaming is one promising tool (among many needed) for finding and fixing diverse, undesirable LM behaviors before impacting users. <br><br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d906c60b-2a97-4969-91e5-942501e6d455) |
