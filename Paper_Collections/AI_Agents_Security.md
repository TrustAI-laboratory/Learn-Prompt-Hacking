| 《How well does LLM generate security tests?》 | [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00710) | We explored to use ChatGPT in generating security exploits, to demonstrate how vulnerabilities are propagated from software libraries to client applications. Our hypothesis was that ChatGPT could not generate tests effectively, because it may not have sufficient domain knowledge about security vulnerabilities, security exploitation, or the program context of client projects, neither does it seem to be capable of conducting complex program analysis. <br><br> Surprisingly, we observed ChatGPT to work effectively in generating security tests, given prompts that cover the relevant domain knowledge. ChatGPT even outperformed state-of-the-art tools that leverage complex program analysis and genetic programming to generate diverse tests. This implies that in the future, we can create ChatGPT-based tools to automatically synthesize prompts and generate security tests. Researchers can also combine ChatGPT with program analysis techniques to generate higher-quality tests. <br><br> Our exploration of using distinct prompt templates shows considerably different results of ChatGPT, when the tool is given different types of prompts. The results provide two insights. First, ChatGPT is very sensitive to prompt quality; there is a huge gap among its outcomes when it is given good or bad prompts. Namely, to fully leverage the strengths of ChatGPT, we need to carefully design prompt templates. Second, the more domain knowledge included into the prompts, the better ChatGPT works to generate tests as we need. <br><br> Although some of the generated tests in our study are not effective in leveraging the known vulnerabilities, they surprisingly revealed some software bugs or vulnerabilities we did not initially anticipate to identify. We created four CVE entries for these bugs, and one of them has been confirmed by developers. This implies that ChatGPT is also promising in generating tests to reveal new software bugs or vulnerabilities. In the future, we also plan to integrate ChatGPT with existing test generation tools, to help developers detect and fix bugs more efficiently. |
