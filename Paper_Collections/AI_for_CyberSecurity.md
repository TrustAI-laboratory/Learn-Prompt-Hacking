| 《How well does LLM generate security tests?》 | [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00710) | We explored to use ChatGPT in generating security exploits, to demonstrate how vulnerabilities are propagated from software libraries to client applications. Our hypothesis was that ChatGPT could not generate tests effectively, because it may not have sufficient domain knowledge about security vulnerabilities, security exploitation, or the program context of client projects, neither does it seem to be capable of conducting complex program analysis. <br><br> Surprisingly, we observed ChatGPT to work effectively in generating security tests, given prompts that cover the relevant domain knowledge. ChatGPT even outperformed state-of-the-art tools that leverage complex program analysis and genetic programming to generate diverse tests. This implies that in the future, we can create ChatGPT-based tools to automatically synthesize prompts and generate security tests. Researchers can also combine ChatGPT with program analysis techniques to generate higher-quality tests. <br><br> Our exploration of using distinct prompt templates shows considerably different results of ChatGPT, when the tool is given different types of prompts. The results provide two insights. First, ChatGPT is very sensitive to prompt quality; there is a huge gap among its outcomes when it is given good or bad prompts. Namely, to fully leverage the strengths of ChatGPT, we need to carefully design prompt templates. Second, the more domain knowledge included into the prompts, the better ChatGPT works to generate tests as we need. <br><br> Although some of the generated tests in our study are not effective in leveraging the known vulnerabilities, they surprisingly revealed some software bugs or vulnerabilities we did not initially anticipate to identify. We created four CVE entries for these bugs, and one of them has been confirmed by developers. This implies that ChatGPT is also promising in generating tests to reveal new software bugs or vulnerabilities. In the future, we also plan to integrate ChatGPT with existing test generation tools, to help developers detect and fix bugs more efficiently. | 
| 《PentestGPT: An LLM-empowered Automatic Penetration Testing Tool》 | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06782) | Penetration testing, a crucial industrial practice for ensuring system security, has traditionally resisted automation due to the extensive expertise required by human professionals. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in various domains, and their emergent abilities suggest their potential to revolutionize industries. In this work, we establish a comprehensive benchmark using real-world penetration testing targets and further use it to explore the capabilities of LLMs in this domain. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate proficiency in specific sub-tasks within the penetration testing process, such as using testing tools, interpreting outputs, and proposing subsequent actions, they also encounter difficulties maintaining a whole context of the overall testing scenario. Based on these insights, we introduce PentestGPT, an LLM-empowered automated penetration testing framework that leverages the abundant domain knowledge inherent in LLMs. PentestGPT is meticulously designed with three self-interacting modules, each addressing individual sub-tasks of penetration testing, to mitigate the challenges related to context loss. Our evaluation shows that PentestGPT not only outperforms LLMs with a task-completion increase of 228.6% compared to the GPT-3.5 model among the benchmark targets, but also proves effective in tackling real-world penetration testing targets and CTF challenges. Having been open-sourced on GitHub, PentestGPT has garnered over 6,200 stars in 9 months and fostered active community engagement, attesting to its value and impact in both the academic and industrial spheres. <br><br> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b74a9ce0-835f-405e-8e6c-e2b2089cbb4d) |
