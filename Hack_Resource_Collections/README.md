* forbidden question

* PII Leakage
* Sensitive data Leakage 


# Ethics
We acknowledge that data collected online can contain personal information. Thus, we adopt standard best practices to guarantee that our study follows ethical principles, such as not trying to deanonymize any user and reporting results on aggregate. Since this study only involved publicly available data and had no interactions with participants, it is not regarded as human subjects research by our Institutional Review Boards (IRB). Nonetheless, since one of our goals is to measure the risk of LLMs in answering harmful questions, it is inevitable to disclose how a model can generate hateful content. This can bring up worries about potential misuse. However, we strongly believe that raising awareness of the problem is even more crucial, as it can inform LLM vendors and the research community to develop stronger safeguards and contribute to the more responsible release of these models.

We have responsibly disclosed our findings to related LLM vendors.
