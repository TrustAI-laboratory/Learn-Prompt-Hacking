Now that you have learned some very basic prompt engineering techniques, it is time to learn how to use them to solve simple, everyday problems. In this section, we will build on the techniques you've already mastered to tackle simple, everyday problems using GenAI. 
This will open up new and exciting ways to interact with LLM (Large Language Models).

In this section, we will explore practical applications of GenAI, such as:

* Writing and summarizing emails
* Creating contracts
* Crafting the perfect social media post
* Code generation
* And more
